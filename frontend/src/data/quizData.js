  1: "yay! u made it to the first level. this is such a cute quiz right. keep playing bc each letter is going to explain my reasoning behind the song choices in the mixtape...\n\nso for song 01 - 04, these are songs I feel describe our situation right now, or at least my current headspace with you.. daniel represents the anxious thoughts, jaden represents our shared interests (common artist we like), gregory is another common artist but this song represents the conversations we have with each other, and boy pablo's song here is just perfect for hugs.\n\nok keep going!!!",
  
  2: "hellooooo, not baddddd, someone's memory is improving!\n\nsongs 05 - 11 all follow a pretty obvious theme. i actually have nothing more to add.\n\nciao.",
  
  3: "hehe congrats for completing the quiz. and hopefully, also for completing do androids dream of electric sheep and at least one episode of westworld.\n\nso there's actually a secret song 12 - 14 in the mixtape!! individually, they were chosen because of their titles. i've honestly not listened to them much either and found them just for the purpose of the mixtape :3 so again, there's not much to say in this letter really.... but if ur still craving for more, u could let me know and im sure human present-time Jennifer will be gracious and kind to entertain your requests. maybe she has a physical letter even!?!? hey u didnt hear it from me.\n\nanyways, hope u had fun ^U^"
